## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Kate suggests that you use Citi Bike data that has been released to the public for your analysis. You agree, but then remind her that you must be cautious when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York City—Des Moines is quite different!

You're excited to find out which data will and will not apply to Des Moines, drawing on both your data expertise and critical thinking skills. You'll also need to rely on Kate's salesmanship during the investor conversations. Kate can sell almost anything, but it's up to you to make sure she's selling something viable.After thinking through various questions, you settle on the first question you would like the data to answer: how many bike trips were recorded during the month of August? Since August is a beautiful time of the year to rent a bike, we want to use this data as a starting point to determine how many rides we could expect in the city of Des Moines.

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.


## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
